When I’m learning something new, I often set a daily reminder – “Spend 30 minutes on reading German”, for example. Or I’ll set a target, such as “Write 100 blog posts by the end of the year”. This follows the *Art and Fear* approach of David Bayles and Ted Orland.

Taking apart the many myths that surround the making of art, the book tries to understand why work *doesn't* get made, pointing out the high casualty rate of art school graduates and how this would be considered a scandal if it were medical students failing to make a living in their field of training.

In a chapter on 'perfection’, the authors offer an anecdote. A ceramics class is divided into those to be graded on *quality* and those to be marked on *quantity*. In the second group, you simply had to produce more to get higher grades. The former had only to produce one piece, but it had to be good.

> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest qualities were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

I always liked this story and once carried it with me as a golden rule. But, while it functions as a parabolic truth, I’ve come to recognise its rhetorical sleight of hand. At the end of a different class, it’s equally possible that neither group produces anything of note. Or both do. Or the *quality* group might produce a masterpiece. There are real-world examples of each scenario. The story remains an anecdote, not a proof.

Instead, the curious fact that emerges from my reminders and targets is that I find myself treading water. I meet every commitment I’ve set myself but, in the absence of a clear outcome, the quantitative aspect itself becomes the focus of attention. I’ll read German for 30 minutes, with the nagging feeling that I haven’t left my comfort zone. Or I’ll meet the word count of a writing deadline, without honestly engaging with the subject matter. 

The *quantity* model says to keep plugging away and lightning will strike eventually. But, just as some measure the success of a working day through an empty inbox and a checked-off task list, there can be the appearance of work without the substance. And what if lightning doesn’t strike? There needs to be some measure of quality after all, it seems. Otherwise, it’s just filling time.

This is a long-winded way of saying that I think habits and quotas alone can set the wrong incentives. The focus needs to be on the outcome and the journey towards it. Otherwise it’s easy to settle for filling the minimum requirement, while tricking yourself that you’re achieving something. It’s what we might call the Procedural Bias – where the brain confuses the intended outcome of a task with the task itself.

I’m trying to approach the things I learn as projects instead of habits. And to ask: What will it *be* when it’s finished? And how will I know?
