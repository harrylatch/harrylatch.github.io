Based on [Sara Buenfeld’s recipe for BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/bread-four-easy-steps "Sara Buenfeld's simple bread recipe"), this is one of the simplest and most foolproof ways to make bread I’ve found. It’s fast, preparation takes less than 15 minutes, and the bread is ready in under two hours. It’s financially competitive with shop-bought bread, although you could definitely pick up a cheaper loaf of some kind. These will contain preservatives to keep the bread fresh for longer and other less desirable ingredients.

It is, however, the satisfaction of baking bread that matters here, and regaining some creativity, connection, and control over what you eat. 

The recipe is vegetarian but check with a vegan first in case they don’t eat yeast. It is not gluten-free.

### What you’ll need

I already had salt, oil, and honey at home, but the other ingredients cost less than £2 and made three big loaves of tasty bread.

- 500g bread flour: I bought a 1.5kg of Allinson’s wholegrain but you can probably get cheaper and can use other kinds of flour. Bread flour contains more protein than all-purpose flour, giving the dough more gluten and a more bread-like consistency
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast: Allinson also do double sachets of 11g fast-action yeast, one of which is perfect for this recipe
- 1 teaspoons of salt
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 tablespoon of clear honey

- You’ll also need a 900g loaf-shaped baking tin, which seems to be the standard, but any shape or size will do at a pinch, as you can always reduce the amount of dough you use. I picked one up in Asda for £1.

- A glass mixing bowl will cost about £5 and plastic versions are available for less. Consider sharing the bowl and tin with a nearby friend or neighbour. A measuring jug and bread board would also be useful.

### How to prepare

1. Measure out 50g of bread flour into a mixing bowl. If you don’t have any scales, you could buy a 50g bag. Or, if you have 1.5kg, you can measure the height of the bag and divide by three. Mark the bag a third of the way down and pour out the flour to roughly that point.
2. Add the yeast and salt to the flour and use your hands to mix them together thoroughly.
3. Run the tap until the water is hot (but not scalding) and measure out 300ml. If you don’t have a measuring jug, then use a pint glass to a little over the halfway point.
4. Stir the oil and honey into the water and add the liquid to the flour.
5. Keep working the ingredients. You will need to scrape flour from the bowl and your fingers and work it back in. Keep going until you have a consistent dough. Only add more water or flour if you really need to.
6. Sprinkle a little flour onto a bread board or other surface and knead the dough firmly for about five minutes. The texture should lose any stickiness and become more elastic.
7. Rub a little oil around the baking tin and evenly press in the dough. It should cover the bottom half of the tin.
8. Put the tin inside a plastic carrier bag and leave to rise, preferably somewhere warm, like an airing cupboard.
9. After an hour, the dough should have risen to fill the tin and the surface should no longer spring back when you prod it.
10. Heat the oven to 200C, 180C for fan ovens, or gas mark 6. Slash the top of the loaf with a sharp knife a couple of times, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the loaf has risen and browned.
11. Tip out onto the bread board (or a cooling rack) and tap the bottom. It will have a hollow sound if cooked. Leave it to cool down.

### Bear in mind

These loaves will harden faster than supermarket bread, so either share or halve and freeze. Ask to store in a friend’s freezer if you don’t have one. You can pay them with a fresh loaf.

You can change up the taste by using different flour, even mixing them together, or replacing 50g of flour with mixed seeds, such as pumpkin and sunflower. It’s fun to experiment once you’ve got used to the recipe.
