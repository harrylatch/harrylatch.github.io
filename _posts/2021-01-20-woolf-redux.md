I love artist’s workspaces. A friend of mine is part of a studio cooperative. They share a floor of a renovated office block and hold open days once a year. I respect the commitment to keeping a separate place for working and imagine the motivational advantage of having a creative environment to go to. Physical locations mirror the mind, and the artists here are making a clear statement of intention. Such collective formality is a powerful thing.

Most make do with a desk at home or, when possible, a laptop in a coffee shop. This appeals to me, too. The itinerant who can and does work anywhere. I like to use university libraries or public spaces, such as the Royal Festival Hall – although many towns and cities are lacking such open environments. But I come back to a place of one’s own because it can be consciously shaped by its inhabitant, a physical manifestation of a practical processes that take place within it. It is almost a sculpture – the creative idea in material form.

For Virginia Woolf, the act of writing is itself is a kind of property, which practitioners need to inhabit and to exercise their rights over. Her ‘room’ is both literal and metaphorical, insisting that women need to be financially and intellectually independent. In England, at least, where housing has become muddled up with speculation, this sounds a little bourgeois. It is a struggle for many to rent a home, let hire a working space.

Collectives, however, might swing with greater force than individuals. I would enjoy reading Woolf’s *A Room of One’s Own* updated for cooperative spaces, something like the allotment model, so that everybody has a place to work and not just the financially emancipated individual.
