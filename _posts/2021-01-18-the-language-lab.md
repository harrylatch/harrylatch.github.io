The use of language matters. It shapes the reality, the limits of what seems conceptually possible. The words for eating are different for animals and humans in German. And the German words are different for human singing and the noises birds make, suggesting a different relationship between the species than in English.

The limits of language are often critiqued, for their role in power structures, for example. But I’m also interested in how expanding language can change one’s perception of reality.

German compound nouns, for example, make abstract states concrete, bringing new chunks of reality into being with nice, crunchy words. In [Ben Schott's neologism](https://newrepublic.com/article/115431/best-new-made-german-words-benn-schotts-schottenfreude "Schottisms"), the literal translation of *Erkenntnisspaziergang* is something like ‘knowledge walk’, which you’ll recognise if you do most of your thinking on your feet. Naming helps bring a fuzzy feeling into focus, the root of talking therapies. 

In fact, this is happening everywhere. In political philosophy, we find the post-growth notion of [zombie energy](http://postgrowth.art "Post-growth zombie energy"), where dead matter threatens to destroy the living. Or the mutual aid concept of [poshterity](https://vimeo.com/393734426 "Poshterity"). 

New genres are the life-blood of culture: [solarpunk](https://solarpunks.net "Solarpunk") and [salvagepunk](http://frankenfiction.com/salvagepunk/ "Salvagepunk") provide a measuring stick for the dystopia or utopia we inhabit. A big part of science is classification, where a field like [xenobiology](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cbic.202000141 "Xenobiology") opens up a new space of existence, and naming cognitive biases helps the human mind to see round corners, as it were. 

Why doesn’t everybody create their own vocabularies, as a way to more clearly define lived reality, but also as a placeholder for a world that might exist?
