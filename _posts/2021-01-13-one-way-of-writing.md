Everybody has something to say. Once you’ve got your teeth into a subject, it pretty much takes care of itself. I find it’s best to have an archive of material in various stages of composition – from scraps of ideas to something like a working draft. I can read through these and something will spark. This material is happy to hibernate and will tell you when it’s ready to work.

But what if nothing speaks to us or we’re looking for something new? What if we don’t have an archive at all? The blank page represents option paralysis: Where do I begin? What should I say *first*? I find the following cuts through paralysis and helps to build an archive pretty quickly.

### Phase One

I buy a reporter’s notebook and a couple of pens with a nice flow of ink. These notebooks are cheap and the right size and density to hold in one hand. They are spiral bound at the top, which is important for turning pages rapidly as you write. The technology is well-developed for its purpose. I get them with 100 ruled sheets (200 sides) with medium spacing. Get a pen you’ll enjoy writing with for a couple of hours at a time.

Under normal circumstances, I’d take these to a café or library, somewhere with the right balance of busy-ness and anonymity. These offer my senses the right amount of distraction, while closing down all opportunities for wasting time. Again, you’ll need to feel comfortable being here for 2-3 hours. You will probably have a favourite place.

As soon as I get there, I’ll buy a coffee and make myself comfortable. I’ll put my phone on silent and well out of sight. And then, without any preparation or preamble, I’ll get down to work.

The first goal is to fill the top line of every sheet with a title. This is only the sheet facing me, leave the back of the page blank for now. Don’t think about it too much. Just pull up a subject or an idea that might be fun to write about, fact or fiction, even if it seems a little goofy, get it onto the page, and move onto the next sheet. There’s no need to explain or justify the title. The rest of the page stays empty for now.

Each idea should take minutes, at most. And once it’s down, forget it. Ideas will come in clusters, filling a string of headlines. Let it flow. You’re not looking for the perfect or even right thing to write about. Speed matters. Don’t think about it too long. With a 200-page notebook, you’ll end up with 100 ideas. I aim to get this done within a single session. Two, at most. 

### Recipes

Sometimes you’ll hit a brick wall and have to look around for inspiration. Here are some suggestions to kickstart ideas, if you’re really stuck:

1. **Extrapolation:** Think of an event that had an effect on you and draw your theme from it. I was off school for several months and when I returned, my old friends acted as if they didn’t know me. A fictional transposition might be the experience of a young mother who suddenly finds herself the victim of social intolerance when the political climate of her society changes. Or I might write a non-fiction essay on the sociological concept of Scapegoat Theory. For now, you just need to give this a descriptive headline.
2. **Collage:** Pick a subject and list three perspectives that express this in different ways. You will intertwine these into a single piece of writing. You might write about different ideas of intoxication, or the experience of coffee from the point of view of the farmer, the vendor, and the consumer. Any topic can be opened up in this way. Here, the headline would be a couple of words for each perspective, separated by a dash.
3. **Reverse Engineer:** Start with a striking situation or visual image and then imagine the logical steps that led up to it. You can flick through a magazine to find dramatic images or work from memory. Write the headline for now. Later you can dig into the genuine backstory or fabricate something completely fictional. Example: a street is filled with thousands of sheets of paper. This is the headquarters of the secret police and their documents have been thrown out of the windows during an uprising.
4. **Meanwhile:** This [Every Frame a Painting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GXv2C7vwX0) explains how Orson Welles structures his film *F for Fake*. Instead of telling a story that follows a sequence of 'and then' plot points, Welles' narratives are connected with 'but' or 'therefore' plot points – events lead *from* one thing to another or they *diverge* from one thing to another. Welles also sets up parallel narratives that cross cut, what George Lucas called "Meanwhile, back at the ranch". Let one story build to peak interest then switch. The prompt here is to pick a story from my life, almost at random, and to find one or more parallels to run alongside. This is similar to the collage prompt – the headline is structured the same – but we're more focused on the story. Podcasts announce a similar trick when they set up a scenario followed by the words “Turns out…”
5. **Ripped From The Headlines:** Pick up a newspaper or magazine – we’re offline here, remember – and free associate around the stories you find. The great thing about this approach is that you often have the framework in place, and might follow the story for a whole news cycle, but you can also quickly grab research material around the topic and paste it in. Keep adding and mixing and altering until this borrowed research is fully integrated in what you're writing. For now, just a headline prompt is enough.

Once the headlines are written, you’re done for the day. Congratulations.

### Phase Two

Once I’ve given every sheet a title, I leave the notebook alone for a couple of days. Then I sit down again and fill both sides of every page as quickly as I can. This phase takes about 16 hours, probably a little longer, so be prepared to spread the process over a number of sessions.

These aren’t notes or placeholders or outlines but an attempt at an actual first draft. I’m forced to improvise and work around any knowledge gaps. I work through these quickly and sequentially, without skipping any pages, and I keep going until both sides of the page are completely full. 

Sometimes I struggle and sometimes I don’t have the room to get everything down. Other times, I have no idea what I meant by the headline, but I’m obliged to think of something to write. The technique forces you to move on and eventually something will land. If I lose my focus, I’ll set a timer and try to finish each idea in under ten minutes. 

Being forced to act has a strange magic for me and already having an idea on the page gives me something to work with. I find I can usually fill the space quite easily. A fat notebook of material gives a sense of bounty and more than enough material for dozens of first drafts. You will have your archive.

Next time around, I may type everything up, freely adding and adapting as I go. More likely, I’ll just dip into the notebook when I need something new. I can skip through until I find a page that speaks to me. Something usually will.

Why not work digitally to start with? Personally, I find something freeing about working with paper and pen on this. It’s tactile and informal and there is a clear sense of structures and boundaries. These bring a sense of achievement missing from the endless scroll of a digital document.
