It seems foolish to state intentions at the start of any project. A blog, after all, will wind like a river through whichever territory that geography and time allows. Who knows what will matter in the months or years to follow, assuming this project itself lasts the first flourish of its existence. Many sites don’t make it. Perhaps the wisest thing would be to post without promises and leave the hypothetical reader to puzzle things out for themselves? But a project must start somewhere and it occurs to me that stating intentions is a good waymarker, to keep me honest and to see how far I’ve travelled.

This introduction aside, this blog aspires to be practical – a place where I learn and then share what I’ve found. This is not unique. Many blogs are built this way. Instead of blogging about blogging, I’d rather engage in a kind of mutual skill exchange. Something like a school, where everybody teaches one another.

To learn what, though? Most topics stem, I suppose from a sense of [social ecology](https://www.thegreenfuse.org/socialecology.htm "social ecology"). I’m interested in tools and tutorials for making things, growing things, mutual aid, shaping the immediate world, and building the kind of society that takes the basic needs of everybody seriously. Topics may include creativity and design justice, open models of technology and economics and education, and ethical travel, as well as how communities can take care of one another. In practice, this could include growing vegetables at home, for example, and using cheap technology.

This is a new world for me and a different way of talking. So take this introduction as a message in a bottle, thrown into the vast ocean in the hope of making contact. I’m still undecided whether to open this site up to comments, but feel free to contact me if you’d like to talk about anything you read here.

All the best
